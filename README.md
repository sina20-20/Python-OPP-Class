# Python Classes and Objects
Think of a class as a blueprint of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. The actual physical house is the object.

class Student:



As shown in the following figure, the same object name can be present in multiple namespaces as isolation between the same name is maintained by their namespace.
print(did_pass)

------------------------------------------

Here, the check_pass_fail() method is defined inside the Student class

Now, any object created from the Student class can access this method.

We have called this method without passing any arguments, however, the method definition takes one argument named self.

Whenever we define methods for a class, we need to use self as the first parameter. This self represents the object calling it. In our example, self refers to the student1 object, and self.marks refers to the marks attribute of student1.


The __init__() Method

Adding attributes to the object manually after defining it is not a good practice.

Python offers a much more elegant and compact way of defining attributes right while instantiating the object. For that, we use the init method.

If you are coming from other languages like C++ or Java, the Python __init__() method closely resembles constructors.



Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.


This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in most efficient way, with the topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Deep-Learning, etc.) with examples.
